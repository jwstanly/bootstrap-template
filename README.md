# Bootstrap Template
A lightweight and modular bootstrap template able to support general front end projects

## Build Process
This template was created using a modified combination of two existing Bootstrap templates from [StartBootstrap](StartBootstrap.com). The result is the two templates complementing each other, as one is oriented towards standard web pages while the other focuses on user accounts and portals. 
 - **[SB Admin](https://startbootstrap.com/templates/sb-admin/)** - "A Bootstrap 4 admin template with minimal custom styling and an advanced development environment - a perfect starter template for building web apps, dashboards, and admin panels"
 - **[Modern Business](https://startbootstrap.com/templates/modern-business/)** - "A full website template framework for building Bootstrap 4 websites with 17 pages and a working contact form"
 
 ## File Organization 
 The file organization has been designed to be as straightforward as possible. 
 - **```css/```** : Contains the single CSS file
 - **```dataVisualizations/```** : Contains JS files for creating [ChartJS](https://www.chartjs.org/) visualizatiosn quickly
 - **```htmlModules/```** : Contains JS files that return the HTML for the navbar, footer, miniFooter, sideNavbar, and sideNavbarTop. This way, if you ever want to edit these aspects of the website, you only have to do it once instead of going through each webpage.
 - **```images/```** : Contains website images
 - **```scripts/```** : Contains general JS and PHP not applicable to the `dataVisualizations/` and `htmlModules/` directories
